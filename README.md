# [EchoBot](https://github.com/JokerJosh1234/EchoBot) Playfab Integration

## Setup
If you havent already, make sure you install PlayFabAllSDK

Navigate to the Playfab.cs script and modify the TitleId and X_SecretKey to match the respective values for your title.

Dont worry about CurrencyCode or Catalog, that will be implemented later.

## Not finshed yet.

This integration is not finished but it creates a base for developers to create their own commands
